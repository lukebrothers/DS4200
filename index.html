            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Luke! I'm a 4th-year honors student at the Bouvé College of Health Sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Health Science and Business Administration, focusing on Healthcare Management and Consulting, along with a minor in Data Science.

                My interests lie at the intersection of healthcare, technology, and business, and I’m captivated by the potential for innovation in these fields. Living in Boston has provided me with numerous opportunities to engage with cutting-edge healthcare companies and explore emerging solutions to address pressing healthcare challenges.
                
                Currently, I serve as a business development consultant for a cancer therapeutics startup, which has further fueled my passion for driving innovation. Additionally, I hold the position of Director at Evolve, a biotech accelerator at Northeastern, where we support early-stage startups in building their businesses. It has been incredibly rewarding to help over ten startups raise a cumulative total of more than $2 million in funding.
                
                I am eager to leverage my education and experiences to make a positive impact on individuals and communities. I hope to inspire conversations about important issues in healthcare and entrepreneurship. Please feel free to reach out via the contact section if you’d like to connect!</p>
